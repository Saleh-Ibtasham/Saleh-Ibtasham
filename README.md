### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saleh, Welcome to my condo !!!  

I'm a software engineering graduate and I still want to pursue this field.  

I am an enthusiast when it comes to technology and software. I like to work on systems design and web development. I also have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± I'm looking into possibilities of integrating machine learning and software analysis.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd like to work with people on formal methods to design software.
- ðŸ’¬ Please do leave comments here in my repos and ask any questions there.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a gamer, I like to sketch anime & I also play the guitar. We've gotta experience everything in life, my friend ðŸ˜†.
